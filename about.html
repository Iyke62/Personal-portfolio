          I’m <strong>Ikemba Osuagwu</strong>, a passionate entry-level
          front-end developer who loves turning design ideas into interactive,
          accessible, and responsive web pages. My web development journey
          started with curiosity about how websites are built, that curiosity
          was transformed into learning and gaining hands-on esperiences in
          building and desiging user friendly and interractive web pages.

        <h3 id="goals-title">Goals in This Program</h3>
        <p>
          My goal is to gain more hands-on experiences in order to strengthen my
          core skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, Bootstrap, and React while
          exploring more challenging tasks. I also aim to build confidence in
          writing clean, maintainable code and to contribute to real-world
          projects that challenge my creativity and problem-solving ability by
          collaborating with other creative minds and also learning from them.

        <p>
          One area I’m still working on is advanced JavaScript logic and
          debugging complex functions. I sometimes find it challenging to
          implement more dynamic interactivity on my own, but I’m improving by
          practicing small projects and following structured learning paths.

          Stay consistent and focused. Remember the curiosity that triggered the
          start of this journey, how far you’ve come and that every bug you fix
          makes you sharper. Keep learning, keep coding, and don’t be afraid to
          take on challenges that seem too big because thats how you grow.

        <p>
          I believe good design goes hand-in-hand with good functionality. My
          long-term dream is to build digital tools that solve real problems for
          people. Collaboration, empathy, and a passion for innovation will
          always be my guiding values.
